## What is Jenkins?

* *Jenkins is an open source continuous integration-continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD) automation software DevOps tool written in the Java programming language. It is used to implement CI/CD workflows, called pipelines.*
    
* *Jenkins is a tool that is used for automation, and it is an open-source server that allows all the developers to build, test and deploy software. It works or runs on java as it is written in java. By using Jenkins we can make a continuous integration of projects(jobs) or end-to-endpoint automation.*
    
* *Jenkins achieves Continuous Integration with the help of plugins. Plugins allow the integration of Various DevOps stages. If you want to integrate a particular tool, you need to install the plugins for that tool. For example Git, Maven 2 project, Amazon EC2, HTML publisher etc.*
    

**Let us do discuss the necessity of this tool before going ahead to the procedural part for installation:**

* *Nowadays, humans are becoming lazyðŸ˜´ day by day so even having digital screens and just one click button in front of us then also need some automation.*
    
* *Here, Iâ€™m referring to that part of automation where we need not have to look upon a process(here called a job) for completion and after it doing another job. For that, we have Jenkins with us.*
    

TASK:

**1\. What you understood in Jenkins, write a small article in your own words**

*Jenkins is an automation tool, developed on java, that basically supports the DevOps culture/ methodology 100%. So what it does is integrate all the tools , from Git(repo) to building the project and then deploying it , giving an interim final overview of how the project is looking. By using Jenkins we can make a Continuous Integration of a project.*

1. Installing Jenkins?
    
    step 1 Go to Amazon ec2 and creates a instance, with Ubuntu OS and free tier eligible resources , t2.micro should work, and once it is up, SSH into to the machine using the connect command in console  
    
    **step 2** Prerequisites, will be Java to be installed in the system
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre
    ```
    
    Check the version of java Installed
    
    ```plaintext
    java -version
    ```
    
    **step 3**Â  Now you can Install Jenkins using below command
    
    ```plaintext
    sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
    
    Â Â https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
    
    echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
    
    Â Â https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
    
    Â Â /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
    
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install jenkins
    ```
    
    **step 4** Â  Note: By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.
    
    * *EC2 &gt; Instances &gt; Click on*
        
    * *In the bottom tabs -&gt; Click on Security*
        
    * *Security groups*
        
    * *Add inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (you can just allow TCP 8080 as well, in my case, I allowed All traffic).*
